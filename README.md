Welcome to the Diba Earbuds 3D Showcase project! This repository features a pair of meticulously designed 3D earbuds, presented on an engaging promotional website. The website is crafted using a combination of HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript, creating an immersive and visually appealing experience for users.

## Technologies Used

1HTML: The structure of the website is built using HTML, ensuring a clean and organized layout.
